<br><br>
## Host It Yourself
You can run your own Wiphat server with NodeJS. Download project and just type `node app.js` in your terminal.
<br><br>
### Handicap
Wiphat is running on your browser via just 2 cookies. It must store your username & room id on client side since I do not want record any information on server side. Because of this, you can __use just 1 room at once__. There is an [issue](https://github.com/kaanklky/wiphat/issues/8) for this.
